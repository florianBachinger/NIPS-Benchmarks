# Shape-Constrained Regression (SCR) Benchmarks
This repository serves as a benchmark suite for shape-constrained regression algorithms, which can integrate prior knowledge about the expected shape of the prediction function.

Our benchmark suite builds upon [established benchmarks for symbolic regression](#credit) and extends them in functionality. We provide python code for generating training data for experiments, a set of validation datasets for result comparison, and the ability to check if a function adheres to the specified constraints.



## Usage

See our `examples` folder for **more code snippets and usage examples**. There we detail the [data sampling](/examples/generate_data.ipynb) methodology and show how to use our [constraint checking](examples/checking_constraints.ipynb) interface. This readme only highlights the key features.


### Generate Benchmark Data
Go [here](/examples/generate_data.ipynb) for more examples.
```python
from SCRBenchmark import FEYNMAN_SRSD_HARD,HARD_NOISE_LEVELS,HARD_SAMPLE_SIZES
from SCRBenchmark import BenchmarkSuite

#creates one folder per equation under the parent folder
# each equation folder contains the info file as json
# and the data files for each configuration as csv
BenchmarkSuite.create_hard_instances(target_folder = './data',
                                        Equations=FEYNMAN_SRSD_HARD,
                                        sample_sizes=HARD_SAMPLE_SIZES,
                                        noise_levels=HARD_NOISE_LEVELS)
```

### Generate Benchmark Data for individual equations
Go [here](/examples/generate_data.ipynb) for more examples.
```python
import SCRBenchmark.SRSDFeynman as srsdf
from SCRBenchmark import Benchmark

ICh6Eq20 = Benchmark(srsdf.FeynmanICh6Eq20)
(training, test) = ICh6Eq20.create_dataset(sample_size=1000, patience= 10, noise_level = 0)
```

### Check if functions adhere to constraints
Go [here](examples/checking_constraints.ipynb) for more detail.
```python
import SCRBenchmark.SRSDFeynman as srsdf
from SCRBenchmark import Benchmark

ICh6Eq20 = Benchmark(srsdf.FeynmanICh6Eq20)
# Raw: exp(-(theta / sigma) ** 2 / 2) / (sqrt(2 * pi) * sigma)
# is monotonic increasing over theta in -inf. <= theta <= 0
# is monotonic decreasing over theta in 0 <= theta <= inf.

#prints true as no constraint is violated
print(ICh6Eq20.check_constraints("-(theta*theta)",use_display_names=True))

#prints false as the decreasing constraint for 0 <= theta <= inf. is violated
print(ICh6Eq20.check_constraints("theta",use_display_names=True))

#prints false as the increasing constraint for -inf. <= theta <= 0 is violated
print(ICh6Eq20.check_constraints("-theta",use_display_names=True))

#prints false as both constraints for x0 (theta) are violated
print(ICh6Eq20.check_constraints("(theta*theta)",use_display_names=True))
```

## Results
We will continuously report on results using benchmark set. Current _preliminary_ results are available for the 18 Feynman bonus equations using shape-constrained polynomial regression (SCPR). The detailed results of SCPR are published in our separate [SCR-Benchmark SCPR result repository](https://github.com/florianBachinger/SCR-Benchmark-SCPR). The methodology and experimental setup are described in our publication.

## Installation 

### pip install

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/florianBachinger/SCR-Benchmarks-NIPS.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/florianBachinger/SCR-Benchmarks-NIPS.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import SCRBenchmark
```

### Credit
We enhance the work of Matsubara et al. by determining the _shape constraints_ that describe the expected function shapes of the benchmark formulas. This knowledge can be used to enforce the behavior of trained prediction models and to e.g., improve extrapolation behavior.
